# ErrGAN: Error Recognition and Intention Guided GAN 

## Overview

**ErrGAN** is a novel approach designed to detect and fix errors in imitation learning tasks. By leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), this framework not only identifies errors but also backtracks to pinpoint the root cause and correct it using an intention-guided mechanism.

The framework consists of two main components:

1. **V_GAN**: Discriminator that evaluates the value of the current trajectory using state sequences, image sequences, and language embeddings.
2. **Q_GAN**: Generator that predicts the optimal action for the current trajectory based on state sequences, image sequences, and language embeddings.

### Key Concepts

#### Error Recognition
- **Backtracking**: Upon detecting an error, the model backtracks to the point where the error intention originated. This is followed by intention-guided corrections to adjust the trajectory.
- **Error + Backtracking + Intention Guided**: The combination of error detection, backtracking, and guided correction to refine the trajectory.

#### Intention Guided
- The model learns to guide the trajectory correction after recognizing an error, ensuring that the new trajectory aligns with the optimal action sequence.

### Mathematical Formulation

- **Q Function**: The Q value is calculated as the cosine similarity between the sampled K actions and the optimal action, providing a measure of how closely the generated action aligns with the optimal one.

### Workflow

1. **Error Detection**: The discriminator (V_GAN) identifies errors in the trajectory.
2. **Backtracking**: The system backtracks 20 steps before the detected error to understand the error intention and its root cause.
3. **Intention-Guided Correction**: The generator (Q_GAN) proposes corrective actions to guide the trajectory back on track.
